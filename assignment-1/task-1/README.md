To execute the code in the `script.sh` file, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./script.sh
```

Make sure you are in the correct directory where the `script.sh` file is located before running the command.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts. If not, you can use the `chmod u+x ./script.sh` command to grant the execute permission.
