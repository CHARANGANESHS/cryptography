To run task 2.1, you can execute the `script.sh` file. To do this, open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located. Then, run the following command:

```
./script.sh
```

Similarly, to run task 2.2, you can execute the `script2.sh` file. Again, navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the following command:

```
./script2.sh
```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts. If not, you can use the `chmod u+x {filename}` command to grant the execute permission.
